# Human Activity Recognition
- Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in videos is a key area in computer vision and artificial intelligence with it’s applications in surveillance, healthcare, sports analysis, and human-computer interaction.
- The objective of this project was to develop a system capable of recognizing various human activities from video data.
- Our proposed solution involved using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal sequence learning.
- By combining the capabilities of CNNs with the temporal reasoning of LSTMs, we aimed to achieve high accuracy in activity recognition.
- UCF50 dataset was used for this project
- Autotagging functionality was also implemented, which printed tags for the recognized activity.
